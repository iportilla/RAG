## Robotics Pathway
The following diagram is merely a suggestion on the order to take our Robotics classes and do not have to be taken in this order. Please check the prerequisites of each class for further information.

 
### Robotics Exploration: CTE83201
Grades: 9, 10, 11, 12
Prerequisites: None
Description: Hands-on exploration of robotics!  If you have little or no experience with robotics, this course is a perfect introduction. You will learn about the wide world of robotics by exploring the different types and uses of robots in our world as well as possible robotic careers. Activities will be very hands-on and youâ€™ll have a chance to explore the different standards of robotics (like design, fabrication, electronics, and computer science) using fun and unique technologies at the Innovation Center. Email wilcox_nathan@svvsd.org with questions.

### Robotics A: Design/Electronics: CTE83205
Grades: 9, 10, 11, 12
Prerequisites: We suggest experience with an introductory robotics course or competitive robotics.
Description: Build Robots That Solve Real Problems Using Arduino!  This course will have a strong focus on how robots are designed and built. It is a foundational course designed to help you build up your robotics skillset and, in turn, prepare you for more advanced and authentic robotic opportunities like advanced classes and competitions. Students will use Arduinos to make an IoT dreamland, explore R&D projects, and gain experience in design, electronics, and mechanical engineering principles!

### Applied Robotics: CTE83202
Grades: 9, 10, 11, 12
Prerequisites: We suggest experience with an introductory robotics course or competitive robotics.
Description: Design robots to save the world!  Explore global problems facing us including food shortage, macroplastic pollution, microplastic pollution, etc. and design robotic solutions!  You will explore how technology can be leveraged to practically improve our world, as well as their use in artistic expression to raise awareness about global issues.Email wilcox_nathan@svvsd.org with questions.

### Advanced Robotics: CTE83204
Grades: 9, 10, 11, 12
Prerequisites: We suggest experience with an introductory robotics course or competitive robotics.
Description: Compete with underwater robots!  This class prepares students to compete against other high school, community college and university teams from around the country and world in the 2024 MATE Underwater Robotics Competition. Our team will design, build, and test an underwater drone, and will also develop a marketing approach to sell our product.  You will learn and apply engineering skills like computer-aided design, fabrication, electronics, programming and principles of aquatic physics. We will at a minimum participate in one regional competition in the US; if we qualify, we will participate in the 2024 MATE World Championships hosted in Tennessee.

Any student is welcome to enroll.  The main requirement is a strong interest in learning something new, a firm commitment to the team, and committing to participating in the International competition in June if the team qualifies.  Fundraising may be required in order to travel to events and acquire some of the course materials. Email wilcox_nathan@svvsd.org with questions. 

Robotics Capstone: CTE83210
Grades:  11, 12
Prerequisites: Instructor Approval
